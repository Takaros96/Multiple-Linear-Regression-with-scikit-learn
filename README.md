# Multiple-Linear-Regression-with-scikit-learn
In this project i built univariate and multivariate linear regression models using scikit-learn,
performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization with seaborn,
evaluated model fit and accuracy using numerical measures such as RÂ² and RMSE and
modeled interaction effects in regression using basic feature engineering techniques
