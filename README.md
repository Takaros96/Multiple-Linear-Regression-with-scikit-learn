# Multiple-Linear-Regression-with-scikit-learn
In this project I Built univariate and multivariate linear regression models using scikit-learn
I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization with seaborn
I evaluated model fit and accuracy using numerical measures such as RÂ² and RMSE
I modeled interaction effects in regression using basic feature engineering techniques
